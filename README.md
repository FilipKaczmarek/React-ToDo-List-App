## CRUD Project

### Reason for the project?
It is important to know what CRUD stands for. Create, Read, Update, Delete. These are the core tasks that every website CMS does. As a developer, everyone needs to know how to manipulate data on the frontend.

### Task
In ReactJS, I created a to-do list. The web application has a simple list of items and a form to add new items. Each item has the ability to be removed from the list.
